# CSC335-Week-5-Assignment

Write an application in which you declare an array of eight first names. Write a try block in which you prompt the user for an integer and display the name in the requested position. Create a catch block that catches the potential ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown when the user enters a number that is out of range. The catch block also should display the error message Subscript out of range.

Examples of the program are shown below:

Enter a number, and I will display a name 
2
Name is Clifford

Enter a number, and I will display a name 
20
Subscript out of range.
